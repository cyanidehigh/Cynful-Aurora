    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Shinigami, or Soul Reapers, are spiritual beings who maintain the balance of souls between the mortal world and the afterlife. They wield Zanpakutō, blades that embody their very soul, and protect mortals from Hollows—corrupted spirits that devour souls.</p>

      <h4>SPIRITUAL NATURE</h4>
      <p>Each Shinigami possesses a unique Zanpakutō and spiritual energy, known as Reiatsu. This energy fuels their combat prowess, abilities, and movement through the worlds of the living and the dead.</p>
